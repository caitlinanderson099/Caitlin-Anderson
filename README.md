# 🌟 Digital Design Portfolio – by Caitlin Anderson

Hi there! I’m Caitlin, a creative and detail-driven Web and UX Designer based in New Zealand. I recently completed a two-year journey in Web, Graphic, and UX Design — and this portfolio is a curated showcase of the work I’ve done along the way.

## ✨ About Me

I specialize in creating digital experiences that feel intuitive, thoughtful, and visually engaging. My background blends design thinking with front-end development, and I have a particular love for hospitality and retail design — where user experience really shines.

This GitHub portfolio features a mix of:

- ✏️ UX case studies
- 🎨 UI design samples
- 💻 Front-end development work (React, HTML/CSS, JavaScript)
- 📱 App & web prototypes

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

I believe great design isn’t just beautiful — it’s useful, accessible, and driven by real user needs. Whether I’m sketching wireframes, crafting UI components, or coding responsive layouts, I always keep the user at the heart of everything.

## 🧰 Tools & Tech I Use

- **Design**: Figma, Adobe XD, Photoshop, Illustrator
- **Code**: HTML, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript, React, Git
- **UX**: User flows, wireframing, prototyping, usability testing

## 💬 Let’s Connect!

If you’re curious about my work, want to collaborate, or just feel like chatting design — I’d love to hear from you.
