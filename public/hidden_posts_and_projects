Featuring soft pastel backgrounds, wavy borders, and whimsical illustrations, each menu captures a nostalgic mid-century vibe while remaining clean and modern. The script-style headings and vibrant color palette evoke a sense of fun and celebration, while the simple layout keeps it user-friendly. Designed to add charm and personality to any bar or event, these menus strike the perfect balance between vintage flair and contemporary style.",
