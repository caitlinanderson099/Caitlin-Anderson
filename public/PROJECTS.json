Key brand motifs—such as storybooks, stars, lanterns, and teddy bears—help create a sense of wonder and adventure that appeals to both children and parents.</p><br><p>I designed this project entirely in Figma, building out the brand identity system, storefront aesthetic, and supporting visuals. Figma’s vector tools and component libraries allowed me to experiment with playful iconography, cohesive color hierarchies, and layout variations that could be applied consistently across touchpoints.</p><br><p>This project demonstrates my ability to craft an immersive brand experience —from color psychology and typography to icon design and storytelling-driven visuals—while also showcasing my skills in using Figma as a professional design tool.</p>"
