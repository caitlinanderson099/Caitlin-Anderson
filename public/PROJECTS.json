I wanted to create something the portrayed high end style so I used some of Lovisa's jewellery items to help that portrayal. Throughout this project I had the chance to learn about time management and how to utilize the resources accordingly. Using Mapbox really helped to make this project feel more 'real world' and not only something I created in a classroom. Creating this project within two weeks helped me to be more diligent with my time and plan stages accordingly and stick to them.",
